# SC1015 Data Science Project

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 which aims to resolve the following question:<br>
*Which country is the best for a family to live in, based on life expectancy, education quality, and peacefulness of the country?*<br>
This project contains 3 files:
1. [Data Extraction]() (Merge four files and make a cleaned DataFrame.)
2. [Data Exploration and Standardisation]() (Standardise data and display pair-plot.)
3. [Data Visualisation and Machine Learning]() (Visualise data and conduct linear ligression.)

This project aims to determine the linear regression model of happiness score for each country and which country is the most "ideal" to live in.

## Models Used
* Linear Regression

## Conclusion
* Our equation is merely a measure of whether it is worth considering the country.
* Life Expectancy, gauged by the quality of healthcare and the percentage of GDP put into the health budget, has the most influence over the decision to live in a country.
* Quality of Education and Peacefulness come 2nd and 3rd respectively.

## A descovered thing we learn from this project
* We considered Unemployment to be a crucial factor in deciding which country is best to live in; however, it has least correlation with all other variables.
